 - Make the main page with the lighthouse and sea background cover 
the whole screen when the site is accessed?  All other sections should be seen when one scrolls down.: Changed the width of the image to 103% (main.css; line 814 .main-slider-img > imgso the image can cover full screen
The upcoming event tab was also taking off because its not real-time 
(i.e the date is static)
 
 - Moved the “AND” and changed it to "&"  using <span style="margin-left: 39%;
    font-size: 40px;"> </span>between where hope are….. and potential are…… between the 2 phrases 

     -  re-labeled the Media tab as Multimedia
