                                    <p class="lh-22 mt-10">The spirit and intent of the book of Judges 6:12-14 conveys a message of distinction, prestige and relevance through servant leadership. In this day and age of identity crisis, the male generation is constantly seeking to discover and appropriate their God given potentials in order to fulfill their assignment in life through purposeful bible cultured lifestyles.
<br>
The men of valor team work together to develop men’s ministry that equip and meets the emotional, social, and spiritual needs of men, thereby strengthening them in their roles as husbands, fathers, business men as well as church and community leaders. As we focus on spiritual growth and developing the total man through Biblical teaching, prayer and periodical group meetings. We intend to impact men of all ages in our community and our world for generations to come. </p>

                                    <p class="lh-22 mt-10">Women have an inherent and genetic ability to procreate and multiply when they are invested with either a seed of love which can be conceptualized in form of embryo, money, idea or resource. They naturally reproduce by yielding greater harvest than what is sown. When this God given virtue finds the right friendship and connection with other women in a spirit filled environment, the results are unlimited.
<br>
The women ministry seeks to address the needs of women of all ages through Biblical based fellowship, Bible study and prayer meetings. The group offers to assist one another in matters concerning marriage, social events, childcare, education and community services. Periodically, the group organizes marriage seminars, health awareness programs and welfare support for needy families within the church and community.</p>

They face numerous challenges of peer pressure, drugs, gang influence, Hollywood and political correctness. Addressing these social problems requires a Bible cultured revolution and spirit enhanced environment where God’s word is shared in simple and practical ways.

Each week, your child can be a part of exciting environments that learn mission minded Godly values at an age appropriate level. God’s word will come alive to your child as they learn to apply it to their everyday lives. We follow several missionary stories to show what God can do through your children. Our top-flight program is designed to strengthen families, encourage parents, develop the leadership, and role modeling potentials in our ‘leaders of tomorrow’.

                                    <p class="lh-22 mt-10">Next to church ministry, community and global missions constitute the cornerstone and lifeline of every church. The spiritual barometer of every well-meaning church is measured not only by how the needs of the local church are met, but by the depth and spread of its impact and relevance to the immediate community and the world at large – making disciples of all nations.
<br>
At the Lighthouse for all nations, we seek to propel and actualize this vision by praying for, recruiting and assisting missionaries on the field. In line with this, we in partnership with other churches in the setting up of International Missions Conference (IMC). Once a year, we jointly host missions’ conference to address issues relating to International missions, and missionaries across the globe.
<br>
 Also, every second Sunday of the month, we pray for at least one nation of the world for revival and church growth. In addition, we send support in cash and kind to missionaries in several countries including but not limited to: China, Malawi, Benin Republic, Mozambique, Nigeria, etc. Therefore, please join us in fulfilling this global mandate as we strive to assist those in the mission fields by sending Bible to distant lands, build and support orphanages, visits and encourage missionaries, families and more importantly, contribute in form of prayers and materials to help less advantaged individuals and families in our immediate community. </p>

                                    <p class="lh-22 mt-10">A church that has no community orientation is a congregation without a relational compass! We believe that what makes a church tick is determined by the level of its engagement with the people, institutions and local agencies in the city. The level of rapport, relevance and collaboration with grass root networks in the community will dictate the impact a church can make on the quality of life of local citizens.
<br>
At Lighthouse for the nations, we are actively involved with Common ground Network, an association of churches and social agencies in Mansfield. In line with this, we operate a food pantry, summer food drive program, Citizenship class, community partnership to eradicate hunger and a Career academy that provide workplace training for allied health professionals. Also, we partner with Hope For You Inc., the community development agency for Redeemed Christian Church of God North America</p>
